## Requirements

- iOS 18.0+ (iPhone-only for v1.0)
- Nextcloud server with OCS API enabled (Nextcloud 15+)
- Admin or group admin permissions on the Nextcloud server

**Note:** This app is currently iPhone-only. iPad support will be added in a future version.

## Architecture

The app is built using modern Swift and SwiftUI:

- **Models**: `NextcloudUser` and `NextcloudGroup` represent the data
- **Services**: `NextcloudAPIService` handles all API communication using async/await
- **ViewModels**: `UserManagementViewModel` manages state and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for a native, responsive interface

## API Endpoints Used

This app uses the Nextcloud OCS API (v1.php):

- `GET /ocs/v1.php/cloud/users` - List all users
- `GET /ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/{userid}` - Get user details
- `PUT /ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/{userid}/enable` - Enable a user
- `PUT /ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/{userid}/disable` - Disable a user
- `POST /ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/{userid}/groups` - Add user to group
- `DELETE /ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/{userid}/groups` - Remove user from group
- `GET /ocs/v1.php/cloud/groups` - List all groups
